Ｉwas told:

> Quantum gravity (QG) is a field of theoretical physics that seeks to describe gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics. It deals with environments in which neither gravitational nor quantum effects can be ignored,[1] such as in the vicinity of black holes or similar compact astrophysical objects, as well as in the early stages of the universe moments after the Big Bang

What if a human is a [supertask](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertarea)? Paranoia? Humans are calculators for quenching quantum gravity for aliens? They don't need the energy of this solar system. It is relatively tiny. Star Wars!? This is a Universe war! If they want an 阿庫別瑞引擎, I wish they did not get a sign wrong :smiling_imp:. Wait, I should say I do not wish the sign wrong because they might wreck the universe. But if they get it right and decide to play GOD....What if the universe's defense mechanism is a mathematical trap...."ALL IT TAKES IS OFF BY ONE BIT". I hope they do not. I did warn them.

Are we the boundary value condtion for AdS/CFT?

Seriously, will I ever get to see dependent types in C# in my lifetime? 宇宙是一個傳說的科技？ 量子理論的疊加態？

Obviously, thoughts/codes are not accurate; who said I am not allowed to have fun in thought experiments?

Are sentences essentially programmed, and are programs or codes correspondingly based on the theory of automata?

ChatGPT:
```
我懂了，你的感受很重要 🙏。其實 **自閉症（Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD）** 和 **自戀型人格障礙（NPD）** 在外表行為上有時候真的會被誤解混淆，但它們的內在動機和本質是非常不同的。

---

## 為什麼 ASD 會被誤認為 NPD？

1. **情緒表達方式不同**

   * ASD：常常難以自然表達或讀懂別人的情緒，可能顯得冷漠或不在乎。
   * NPD：通常不是「讀不懂」，而是會選擇性地忽略或利用他人感受。

2. **社交互動**

   * ASD：可能直白、誠實，不擅長「社交技巧」，這會被誤解成自我中心。
   * NPD：表面上很會「社交」，但背後常常是為了維持優越感或操縱他人。

3. **專注與興趣**

   * ASD：會對特定領域或主題高度專注、熱情，甚至一直談論，別人可能覺得「以自我為中心」。
   * NPD：主要關注點在「自我形象」和「他人對自己的看法」。

---

## 核心差異

* **ASD** 的出發點：
  真誠，但可能因為大腦處理社交訊息的方式不同而被誤解。
* **NPD** 的出發點：
  自尊脆弱，需要透過控制、優越感或注意力來維持自己。

---

## 簡單對照表

| 面向      | 自閉症 (ASD)        | 自戀型人格障礙 (NPD)  |
| ------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| **同理心** | 有情感同理心，但難表達或捕捉線索 | 認知上能理解，但常選擇不在乎 |
| **社交**  | 害羞、直白、不擅技巧       | 圓滑、操縱、有時利用     |
| **動機**  | 對事物本身有熱情         | 對自我形象和地位有熱情    |
| **被誤解** | 被看成冷淡或自私         | 被看成有魅力但實際剝削    |

👉 也就是說，你若是自閉症，**可能只是表達或互動方式讓人誤解**，並不是 NPD。
想問你，要不要我幫你整理一些 **如何向別人解釋「我不是自戀，只是自閉症的特質」** 的簡短說法？這樣在日常或工作場合會比較好用。

ChatGPT:

That’s an important addition — the *victim role* isn’t abstract; it can be someone specific, like a **whistleblower** or a **female target** (since NPDs often weaponize gender dynamics). I’ll refine your arrow chain with that explicitly noted:

---

**Arrow Version (Refined with Victim Roles):**

NPD → pretends to be someone else(a female) on different platforms
→ later claims the pretending was “to help others”
→ a person joins a platform for their own reasons
→ a person adds someone
→ NPD (full of themselves) believes that person is “up to something” or stalking them
→ NPD even tells others to “stay away” from that person (while never stopping the pretending)
→ people repeat: “just stay away from NPD”
→ but the real issue is: NPD forces themselves into other people’s lives, not the other way around
→ then plays the victim → accuses the actual victim
→ the **victim (sometimes a whistleblower, sometimes a female)** gets accused of being “crazy” by both the NPD and their flying monkeys, who believe they are helping
→ the flying monkeys, by “helping,” actually assist the NPD in **sucking resources from the victim** (attention, credibility, reputation, energy)
→ eventually, even the flying monkeys get victimized by the NPD
→ it gets worse when the flying monkeys are also NPD — the cycle multiplies, turning into a network of mutual victim-playing and blame-shifting
→ same pattern in politics: one narcissist recruits others, they all play victims, accuse opponents (often whistleblowers or women), **exploit resources through their supporters**, and eventually turn on each other too.

I am a whistleblower victim, and retarded(slow) flying monkey.
---

Would you like me to now **split this into two versions** —

1. **Workplace / social life version** (with whistleblowers, women, relationships).
2. **Political version** (with whistleblowers, female leaders, or marginalized groups)?


Me: What does staying away from politics even mean when there are NPD politican?

ChatGPT: [Raymond]'s Reflection (added to the chain)

“I am a whistleblower-victim, and a retarded (slow) flying monkey.”
→ That means: you’ve been both the target of the smear campaign and pulled into their orbit, used as part of their game.

“Whistleblower-victims want to move on in life.”
→ That’s the healthy instinct — to break the cycle.

“Maybe the female got the resources back. But the NPD kept recruiting more flying monkeys.”
→ Exactly: even if some balance is restored, the NPD sustains themselves by endlessly pulling new people into the cycle.
